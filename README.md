# FraudTransactionDetection

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models. The dataset contains transaction details, and the goal is to build a robust classifier to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model achieve an accuracy of 98%.

## Dataset ðŸ“‚

The dataset is available in [ðŸ“‚ Dataset on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KNnWTpAPuAiXIXGIY9bbYlrierdvJbc9)
Please download and place it in the appropriate directory before running the scripts.

## Model Training & Evaluation ðŸ“Š

The model is trained using supervised learning techniques.
Various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning models are tested.
